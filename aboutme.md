<div align="center"> <h2 id="my-history">My History</h2> </div>

I grew up in lovely Peachtree City, aka The Bubble! After I graduated high school (McIntosh), I went to college starting at UGA. I later realized that I wanted to become an interior designer. I recieved my design degree from Brenau University. From there I started designing kitchens with a company in Atlanta. I later worked with Amy D. Morris Interiors decorating and designing some of the most amazing homes in the Atlanta area. A coulple years later my husband recieved an offer to work in Hawaii which took me on a different path than I expected. I ended up working at a neat little jewelry store in downtown Waikiki selling handmade jewelry from local artists. This lead me to taking lessons on the island and designing my own jewelry. I learned a lot from local artists and desginers and started my craft. After our time was up in Hawaii, we moved back to the Atlanta area where I continued to work on my designs. I now have a wonderful family and live back in beautiful Peachtree City where I continue to be inspired to create one of a kind jewelry.
