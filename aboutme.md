## My History

I grew up in lovely Peachtree City, aka The Bubble! After I graduated high school (McIntosh), I went to college starting at UGA. I later realized that I wanted to become an interior designer. I recieved my design degree from the _insert school here_. From there I started designing kitchens with a company in Atlanta. I later worked with Amy D. Morris interiors decorating and designing the most amazing homes in the Atlanta area. My husband recieved an offer to work in Hawaii which took me on a different path than I expected. I ended up working at a neat little jewelry store in downtown Waikiki selling handmade jewelry from local artists. This lead me to wanting to design my own jewelry so I started taking lessons on the island. I learned a lot from local artists and desginers and started my craft. After our time was up in Hawaii, we moved back to the Atlanta area where I continued to work on my designs. More to come ...
